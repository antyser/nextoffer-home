If we elect to do so, you agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement of any such legal dispute, claim or cause of action within 60 days of the delivery of such email.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-300 mt-6">c. Mandatory Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
            All claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to these Terms or any of the matters or transactions contemplated by these Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of these Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration to be seated in the State of Delaware by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules"). The arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules. The award or decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and the parties expressly waive any right under the laws of any jurisdiction to appeal or otherwise challenge the award, ruling or decision of the arbitrator. The judgment of any award or decision may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary. If any party elects to have a Dispute resolved by arbitration pursuant to this provision, no party hereto shall (or shall permit its representatives to) commence, continue or pursue any Dispute in any court; provided, however, that we will be entitled to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this provision and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which we are entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such injunctive relief or specific performance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-300 mt-6">d. Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>
            <p>
            The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that: (i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (ii) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-300 mt-6">e. Confidentiality of Arbitration</h3>

This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-300 mt-6">f. Section 11</h3>
            <p>
            To the extent that any court is required to weigh on the enforceability of Section 11, to enforce any judgment of the arbitrator, then, without limiting Section 11 or any other provision of these Terms, the User:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware for such purpose;</li>
            <li>agrees not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising in connection with or based upon this instrument or the matters contemplated by this instrument except before the courts of the State of Delaware;</li>
            <li>hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this instrument or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-300 mt-6">g. No Class Actions Permitted</h3>
            <p>
            You hereby agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with respect to any dispute shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and expressly waive any right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You may bring claims against us other only in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue of the courts in the state of Delaware to accept service of process by mail with respect to such dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such dispute.
